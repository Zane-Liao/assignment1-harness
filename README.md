# CS329Z Assignment 1: Building an Agentic Harness

This is the starter repository for Assignment 1.

**Start by reading the handout, [`hw1.pdf`](hw1.pdf), in this directory.**
It states every problem, what is graded, and the design decisions that
are yours to make. This file covers setup, the commands you will run, and
where things are.


## Setup

1. Install `uv`, which manages Python and the dependencies:
   https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

   The assignment needs Python 3.11 or newer. `uv` installs one if you do
   not have it. macOS, Linux and Windows are supported. On Windows, also
   install Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win, default
   options): the terminal sandbox runs commands with the `bash.exe` it
   ships, and there is no operating-system jail on Windows (see "The
   terminal sandbox" below). WSL works too and gives you the Linux jail.

2. Create your `.env` file and add your API key:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open `.env` and fill in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. The file is gitignored. Do not
   commit it.


3. Unpack the email archive. It ships in the repository as
   `data/emails.jsonl.gz` (19 MB). This command verifies its checksum and
   unpacks it to `data/emails/emails.jsonl` (58 MB):

   ```sh
   uv run python data/download.py
   ```

4. Run the tests. In the starter, every test fails with `NotImplementedError`:

   ```sh
   uv run pytest
   ```

Run every command from the repository root with `uv run`. The first
`uv run` creates the environment in `.venv/`.

## Tests

There are two kinds of tests, in the same files under `tests/`.

**Deterministic tests** run by default and make no model calls. Where your
code needs a model, they pass a `ScriptedLM`, a stand-in that replays a fixed
list of replies.

```sh
uv run pytest                          # all deterministic tests
uv run pytest tests/test_priority.py   # one problem
```

**Live tests** call the real model and compare your results against the
thresholds in `tests/thresholds.py`. They cost money.

```sh
uv run pytest -m live -s                          # all live tests
uv run pytest tests/test_priority.py -m live -s   # one problem
```

A live test takes from a few seconds to a few minutes (`priority` makes 60
model calls, about a minute), and pytest prints nothing while it waits.
`-s` makes each test print its score and the items your code got wrong,
whether or not it passes.

While you iterate, `CS329Z_EVAL_SLICE=N` runs each live test on its first
N items only. You can set it on the command line or in `.env`:

```sh
CS329Z_EVAL_SLICE=5 uv run pytest tests/test_priority.py -m live -s
```

## Seeing what your pipelines produce

The tests report scores. To read the output itself, run a pipeline on real
data:

```sh
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.show priority em-01553 em-06665     # label and reason per email
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.show digest 2001-06-22 --labels --limit 30   # the digest, plus each label
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.show email_qa "Who leads the Basin Analytics move?"
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.show search_docs "parental leave"
```

Each prints the result and the cost and time of the model calls. A repeat
with unchanged code is free.

## Model calls and spending

All model calls go through `cs329z_hw1.llm.LM`: a list of
`{"role", "content"}` messages in, a string out.

```python
from cs329z_hw1.llm import LM

lm = LM()            # the grading model, openai/gpt-6-luna
judge = LM("judge")  # the evaluation's judge model, openai/gpt-6-sol
text = lm([{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}])
```

The wrapper does three things:

- **Cache.** Each reply is stored under `.lm_cache/`, keyed on the model,
  the sampling settings and the exact messages. Repeating an identical call
  returns the stored reply and costs nothing.
- **Ledger.** Each call that reaches the provider is appended to
  `.lm_cache/ledger.jsonl` with its token counts and cost. Print the totals
  by model and by tag (the test suite tags each call with the test name)
  with:

  ```sh
  uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.llm
  ```

- **Budget.** The key we issue you has a spending limit on our side, and
  calls fail once it is reached. `CS329Z_BUDGET_USD` (in `.env` or the
  environment) is a second limit you set for yourself: once the ledger
  total reaches it, the wrapper raises `BudgetExceeded` instead of making
  a call, so a runaway loop stops before the key does. Cached replies are
  still returned.

Deleting `.lm_cache/` deletes both the cache and the ledger.

## How to work a problem

Your code goes anywhere inside the `cs329z_hw1` package, and the tests
reach it only through the functions in `cs329z_hw1/adapters.py`, which ship
as stubs that raise `NotImplementedError`.

For each problem:

1. Read the problem in the handout.
2. Open the adapter it names in `cs329z_hw1/adapters.py`. The adapter's type
   hints and docstring are the exact signature the tests use.
3. Implement the functionality in your package, for example in
   `cs329z_hw1/pipelines/priority.py`.
4. Replace the stub's body with a call into your code:

   ```python
   def run_priority(email, lm):
       from cs329z_hw1.pipelines.priority import classify_priority
       return classify_priority(email, lm)
   ```

5. Run that problem's tests, deterministic first and then live.

The deterministic tests are the complete list of the error handling we
require (an empty reply, a reply in the wrong format, a cut-off tool call,
a tool that raises). Nothing is graded that is not in a test or asked for
in the design memo.

The types that cross the adapter boundary (`Email`, `ToolSpec`, `ToolCall`,
`ToolResult`, `ParsedResponse`, `AgentConfig`, `AgentResult`, and others) are
defined in `cs329z_hw1/types.py`. Use them as they are.

## Repository layout

Files marked *provided* are course code, which grading replaces with its
own copies, so read them but do not edit them. Files marked *read* define
interfaces you build on or rules the tests check, and each is worth
reading before the problem that first uses it.

You may add files and subpackages inside `cs329z_hw1/`. Grading copies
your whole `cs329z_hw1/` package into a clean starter and discards
everything else, so a helper you put under `tests/` or anywhere outside the
package is not there when we grade. Do not add dependencies to
`pyproject.toml`; NumPy is already one, and you may use it anywhere.

## The terminal sandbox

`cs329z_hw1.sandbox.run_terminal(cmd)` runs one shell command for your
agent. Read `cs329z_hw1/sandbox.py` before you use it. Its module docstring
lists what each layer stops and what it does not. One of those layers is an
operating-system jail that is not available on every machine. To see which
one your machine uses:

```sh
uv run python -c "from cs329z_hw1 import sandbox; print(sandbox.jail())"
```

This prints `sandbox-exec` (macOS), `bwrap` (Linux with bubblewrap
installed and permitted), or `none`. With `none`, a command that runs
`python3` can reach the network and any file your account can. On Linux you
can install bubblewrap with your package manager (for example
`sudo apt install bubblewrap`).

On Windows it always prints `none`: there is no OS jail there, so the
allowlist, the scrubbed environment and the timeout are the only limits.
The shell and the allowed programs (`grep`, `sort`, `awk` and the rest)
come from Git for Windows, so it must be installed; without it every
command is rejected with a message that says so. Commands are written as on
Linux (`grep`, `wc -l`, pipes, `python3 -c '...'`); `python3` is the Python
that `uv` installed, without the project's packages. Line endings in a
command's output are normalized to `\n`.

Each command runs in a workspace directory that holds `emails.jsonl` and
`docs/`. Here-documents (`<<EOF`) are rejected; multi-line Python goes in
`python3 -c '...'`.

## The simulated-user evaluation

```sh
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.simulation --slice 3   # the first 3 personas
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.simulation             # all public personas
```

This plays each persona in `tests/fixtures/personas/` against the agent
behind `run_agent_session` and saves the conversations under `runs/`. Pass a
directory as the first argument to use other personas. See
`uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.simulation --help` for the options.

## Chatting with your agent

Once `run_agent_session` works, you can talk to your agent in the terminal.

```sh
uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.chat [--mode confirm|auto] [--memory-dir DIR]
```
