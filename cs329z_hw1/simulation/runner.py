"""The conversation runner (course-provided).

``run_persona`` plays one persona against your agent and scores the result:

1. For each of the persona's sessions it builds an ``AgentConfig`` and calls
   ``make_session(config)`` to get a fresh agent session. Sessions of one
   persona share ``memory_dir`` and nothing else.
2. It alternates: the persona writes a message, ``session.send(message)``
   returns the agent's reply, the persona reads it. The session ends when
   the persona says its goal is met, gives up, or has used its user turns.
3. It runs the persona's programmatic checks and then the judge.

A conversation succeeds only if the agent did not raise, every check
passes, and the judge passes.
