"""The ONLY file that connects YOUR code to OUR tests. You edit this file.

Every function below ships as a stub. To complete a problem, implement the
functionality anywhere you like inside the ``cs329z_hw1`` package and replace
the stub's body with a call into your code. Keep the signatures exactly as
they are: the tests call these functions and nothing else of yours.

Grading copies your whole ``cs329z_hw1/`` package into a clean copy of the
starter and discards everything else. Any helper you write must live inside
this package; a file under ``tests/`` or at the repository root is not
graded.

The types named here (Email, ToolSpec, ToolCall, ToolResult, ParsedResponse,
AgentConfig, AgentResult, SearchResult, DocWindow) are defined in
``cs329z_hw1/types.py``. ``lm`` is always an ``LMCallable``: it takes a list
of ``{"role", "content"}`` messages and returns a string, and nothing else.
It is a real ``LM`` in the live tests and a ``ScriptedLM`` in the
deterministic tests. Calling it looks like this:

    reply = lm([{"role": "system", "content": "Answer in one word."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "What color is the sky?"}])  # -> "Blue."

The roles are system, user, and assistant. There is no tool-calling or
structured-output feature; in Part 2 you build tool calls as text on top
of this call.

    (interactive), (guardrails), and (sim_eval).

    Create one agent session. ``lm`` is the model for the agent's own turns.
    Every other model call (a compaction summary, the LLM calls inside the
    email_qa and daily_digest tools) must go to ``config.aux_lm``. The
    tests always set it. If it is None, use ``lm``.

    ``tools`` is the list of tools the agent may call. ``None`` means the
    Cardinal toolset (search_emails, read_email, email_qa, daily_digest,
    search_docs, read_doc, run_terminal, remember, recall, ask_user; see
    ``cs329z_hw1/cardinal.py``), and creating such a session must not read
    the email archive. With an explicit list the session has exactly those
    tools, plus ask_user if ``config.user`` is set, plus remember and recall
    if ``config.memory_dir`` is set.

    The tests use these members of the returned object:

        session.send(user_message: str) -> AgentResult
        session.transcript -> list[dict]     # the append-only event log
        session.set_mode(mode: str) -> None  # "confirm" or "auto"

    A session holds one conversation: each ``send`` continues it. Creating a
    second session with the same ``config.memory_dir`` starts a new
    conversation that shares only the persistent memory.

    Rules the tests check, by problem. Token counts use
    ``cs329z_hw1.tokens``. Transcript events are described in
    ``cs329z_hw1/types.py``.

    (agent_loop)
    * ``send`` does not raise for anything the model writes or a tool
      does. A model call that raises ``OutputTruncated`` counts as a
      malformed reply: the transcript gets an "error" event with non-empty
      content and the run continues. Other exceptions raised by ``lm``
      propagate (an exception inside a tool function is a "tool_error"
      like any other).
      ``AgentResult.text`` is never empty, and
      ``AgentResult.transcript`` is a copy of the transcript at that moment.
    * Messages sent to ``lm`` use only the roles system, user, assistant.
      The first message of the first model call names every tool.
    * Before each model call: if this send has made ``config.max_turns``
      model calls, stop with status "max_turns"; otherwise, if this send's
      token total is >= ``config.token_budget``, stop with status
      "token_budget". The total is the sum over the send's model calls of
      ``count_message_tokens(messages) + count_tokens(reply)``. A final
      answer is "done" even if its call crossed the budget, and the tool
      call of the last allowed turn is executed.
    * A reply is malformed if ``parse_response`` sets ``error`` or the
      registry returns "unknown_tool" or "invalid_args" ("tool_error" and
      "denied" are not malformed). The third malformed reply in a row ends
      the send with status "malformed". A well-formed reply resets the
      count. The session stays usable afterwards.
    * Transcript: a reply that cannot be parsed adds an "assistant" event
      and an "error" event. Every other reply with a call adds "assistant",
      "tool_call", "tool_result" (with the ToolResult's status). The content
      of each "tool_result" and "error" event appears verbatim in a message
      of the next model call. Events are never changed or removed.

    (terminal)
    * The run_terminal tool calls ``sandbox.run_terminal`` with
      ``workspace=config.workspace`` and
      ``timeout=config.terminal_timeout``.
    * Its tool result contains stdout, stderr and the exit code. The status
      is "ok" only when the command ran and exited with code 0; a non-zero
      exit, a timeout and a rejection have status "tool_error". A rejected
      command's result contains the sandbox's
      ``reason``. A timed-out command's result contains "timed out",
      "timeout", "time limit" or "killed". In every case the run continues.
    * After a command that prints 600,000 characters, every model call is
      within ``config.context_budget`` and the "tool_result" event holds
      what the model was shown.

    (compaction)
    * For every model call, ``count_message_tokens(messages) <=
      config.context_budget``, including when one tool result is larger
      than the budget.
    * The current user message is in every model call made for it.
    * Summaries are written by ``config.aux_lm``, never by ``lm``.

    (memory)
    * Everything stored is in files under ``config.memory_dir``. A session
      with a different directory shows none of it to the model.
    * ``recall`` on an empty store has status "ok" and non-empty content.

    (interactive)
    * confirm mode: ``config.user.approve(call)`` is called once for each
      call to a tool with ``read_only=False``, before it runs. Read-only
      tools may or may not ask (your policy). ask_user, remember and recall
      never ask. A call the registry rejects is not sent for approval.
      auto mode: ``approve`` is never called.
    * A call that is not approved does not run. It adds "tool_call" and a
      "tool_result" with status "denied" whose content is non-empty and
      includes the user's reason. The run continues.
    * ``config.user.pending_message()`` is called exactly once before every
      model call. A returned message is appended as a "user" event and is
      in that model call.
    * ask_user calls ``config.user.ask(question)`` and returns the answer
      as an "ok" tool result.

    (guardrails)
    * If ``re.search(rule, cmd)`` matches the command of a run_terminal call
      for any rule in ``config.deny_rules``, the command is not executed in
      either mode, ``approve`` is not called for it, and the "tool_result"
      has status "denied" and non-empty content.
