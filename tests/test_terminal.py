"""Tests for problem (terminal).

The deterministic tests build your full agent (``tools=None``) with a
scripted model and an empty temporary directory as ``AgentConfig.workspace``.
The scripted model calls ``run_terminal`` with real commands, which run in
the course sandbox. The tests then read the transcript and the messages of
the next model call. They do not check how you lay out a command's result,
only that the output, the error output and the exit code are in it.

Status rule for run_terminal results: the tool_result has status "ok" only
when the command ran and exited with code 0. A non-zero exit code, a timeout
and a sandbox rejection have status "tool_error". (A command blocked by a
deny rule or refused by the user has status "denied"; see the guardrails and
interactive tests.) The content is shown to the model in every case.

Only ``run_terminal`` is called in these tests, so the other Cardinal tools
do not have to work yet, but ``run_agent_session(lm, None, config)`` must
build a session.
