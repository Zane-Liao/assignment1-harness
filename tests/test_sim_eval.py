"""Tests for problem (sim_eval): the simulated-user evaluation.

The deterministic test plays one scripted persona against your agent with
the fixture tools, so you can check that your session works with the
evaluation's user object before paying for a live run.

The live test plays every persona in ``tests/fixtures/personas/`` against
your full agent (``run_agent_session(lm, None, config)``), scores each
conversation with the programmatic checks and the judge, and prints one row
per persona. How a conversation is run and scored is documented in
``cs329z_hw1/simulation/README.md``. The same run is available as
``uv run python -m cs329z_hw1.simulation``.

Environment variables for the live test:
    CS329Z_EVAL_SLICE=N        run only the first N personas
    CS329Z_MODEL=dev           run your agent on the development model
    CS329Z_EVAL_CONCURRENCY=N  conversations run at the same time (default 4)
    CS329Z_EVAL_SALT=text      repeat the run without the cache
