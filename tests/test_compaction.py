"""Tests for problem (compaction).

The rule under test: for every model call your agent makes,
``count_message_tokens(messages) <= config.context_budget``, however long
the session is. The transcript is a log and is never shortened.

The deterministic tests use the fixture tools, a scripted model, and
``canned_aux`` as ``AgentConfig.aux_lm``. If your compaction calls a model
(for a summary), it must call ``aux_lm``, not the agent's model: the scripted
model has exactly one reply per agent turn, and an extra call ends the test
with ScriptExhausted.

COMPACTION_BUDGET is 4000 tokens. Your system prompt with the seven fixture
tools rendered must fit in it with room for the conversation (the reference
solution's is under 1000 tokens).
