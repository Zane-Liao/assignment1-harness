"""Tests for problem (agent_loop). Deterministic: no model calls.

Each test builds a session with ``run_agent_session`` from a ScriptedLM and
the fixture tools in ``tests/fixture_tools.py``. Scripted tool calls are
written in your own format by ``run_format_tool_call``. The tests read three
things: the messages your agent sent to the model (``lm.calls``), which
fixture tools ran (``fx.calls``), and the transcript. They never check the
wording of your prompts or how you present a tool result to the model, only
that the result's content string appears somewhere in the next model call.
