"""Tests for problem (search_docs).

The deterministic tests call ``run_search_docs`` and ``run_read_doc`` directly
and compare what they return with the files in ``data/docs/``.

Rules the deterministic tests check:

* ``run_search_docs(query, k)`` returns a list of at most k dicts with the
  keys doc_id, title, snippet. doc_id and title are those of a real document
  (see ``cs329z_hw1.data.load_docs``). A query that matches nothing returns [].
  Two results may come from the same document (for example two passages of
  it), and a result may carry keys besides these three.
* A snippet is at most SNIPPET_MAX_TOKENS tokens and contains text from its
  document.
* ``run_read_doc(doc_id, start_line)`` returns a window that starts at
  start_line. Its text is exactly lines start_line..end_line of the file
  (1-based, inclusive), joined by newlines, and is at most WINDOW_MAX_TOKENS
  tokens. Reading again from end_line + 1 continues without a gap, and the
  last window ends at total_lines.
* An unknown doc_id, or a start_line outside 1..total_lines, raises
  ValueError or LookupError (KeyError and IndexError are LookupErrors). Your
  registry turns the exception into a tool_error the model can read.

The live test asks your full agent 20 questions about the documents.
